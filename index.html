      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>
        First and foremost, use the 'number' field that is located right below
        the 'question' box to guess your number. You should guess the right
        number that is hidden in this 'question' box to win the game. Each and
        every time you guess the wrong number, your score decreases. Your
        highscore will be, as the name says, your highest score. In other words,
        your highscore will be the number from which you guessed the right
        number that is hidden in the question box. Which means, if your score
        was 15 when you guessed the right number, your highscore will be 15. And
        if on the second round of the game your score is 19, your highest score
        will now be 19. Good Luck!
